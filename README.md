ask ai to write a more detailed readme, this is almost completely vibe coded anyways

run this shit on railway or sum to test, initialize db: python init_db.py, then start the bot: python bot_fixed.py.

keep your db secure, and put it in persistent storage or sum, or back it up and keep it in your repo like a madman. (or move it to a /data folder).

anyways, this code is basically shit, but works. much of it is useless by now, but haven't deleted any.

glhf, don't use in prod, this is just an example, not safe to use at all.

and please, don't get people to gamble with this thing, educational only here.
